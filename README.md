My Rock Paper Scissors Project

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game made with javascript in an HTML file. 
The entire game is played through the browser console for now. However, I will
revisit this project later on to work on the front end.

Type in game() in the browser console to begin. It is best out of 5 and the first to 3 
wins, wins the game. Input your choice in the prompt box, it is case insensitive, so do
not worry about that.

Hope you enjoy,
Erik
